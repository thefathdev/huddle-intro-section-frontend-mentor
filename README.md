## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first solution for Front End Mentor Challenge. I am really excited about it. Applying bootstrap css framework that I learned earlier to this project is quite challenging. Also, using scss to customize boostrap.

I watched a bunch of tuts in youtube when I coded this challenge.

### Continued development

I'm interested to make this introductory section to have some kind of animation.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 tuts by Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR) - This helped me learned Bootstrap 5.
